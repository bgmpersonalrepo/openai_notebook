       "'This repository contains two Python scripts, written by Jonathan Dawson, that demonstrate how to read a .parquet formatted file into a PySpark in-memory SQLContext table and run SQL queries against it. \\n\\n1. The first script, \"nations-parquet-sql.py\", is configured to run on the AWS EMR Spark service inside a Zeppelin notebook and pulls a parquet file from AWS S3. It first loads the parquet file into an RDD DataFrame and registers it as a temporary table. Then, it performs SQL queries on this table and prints the results. It also includes a function to print a horizontal line for readability. \\n\\n2. The second script, \"nations-parquet-local.py\", is similar to the first one, but it\\'s configured to run against a local instance of Spark and pulls the .parquet file from the local file store. It has the additional feature of setting a specific application name and executor memory for the SparkContext.\\n\\nBoth scripts run two SQL queries: one that selects all data from the temporary table and another that filters countries containing the term \"UNITED\". The scripts are written in Python 2.7 and use PySpark version 1.6.1.'"
